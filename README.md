# sql-challenge
Data engineering &amp; Data analysis

There isn't much to say on this homework.  

I utilized the JOIN feature the most and just altered my approach with it to accomplish the query I wanted.

I found that nesting the join was a very useful tool in this set of exercises.  In general I find the SQL 
language very intuitive and I like the flexibility of the statements.  

I did not get a chance to approach the bonus this time.  I have had a head cold for a week and have been hoping 
it would pass.  It caused me to put of the homework until the night before it was due.
